            <h2>Experience Counts</h2>

            <p>DVO Media are experts in our field, this is largely due to the extensive experience of our developers. We've been coding websites and applications for many years. Working for a variety of corporate and bluechip companies, as well as smaller web development studios and in house development teams, we have seen it all. Our developers have mentored, coached and managed development teams which is immensly useful when recruiting new developers. The talent at DVO Media is second to none, and no one is afraid to introduce new technologies and push the boundaries even further.</p>

                    <h3>Built using Go</h3>
                    <p>This site is built using Google Go (or Golang if you prefer) and is using a responsively designed theme. The page load time on a development machine is approximately 5ms, which is crazy fast compared to most websites out there, that's largely thanks to Go having great performance - some have measure it to be up to 1000x faster than some other languages. Some companies are saving thousands of pounds on server architecture by building performant systems. To see how DVO Media can help speed up your website or web application click below.</p>
